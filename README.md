  ### Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the background of the customers of a bike shop. By analysing
different aspect of the sales data, I seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations and gain a deeper understanding
of the company's customers in order to improve the decisio-making knowledge of the stakeholders. Also, an interactive dashboard was created in order for the information to be filtered and sorted in real time by the stakeholders.

  ### Data sources

Bike customer data: The primary dataset used for this analysis was the "Excel Project Data.xlsx" containing detailed information about
each customer of the Byke shop.

  ### Tools

 - Excel - Data preparation, data cleaning, data analysis, data visualisation (dashboard) [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/ro-ro/microsoft-365/excel?market=ro).

  ### Data Preparation and Cleaning

In the initial data preparation phase I performed the following tasks:
1. Data loading and inspection (sorting, filtering, etc.).
2. Removing duplicate values.
3. Finding and replacing "M" with "Males", "F" with "Females", etc.
4. Formating currency values.
5. Dividing ages into 3 different intervals: "First age", "Middle age" and "Old" (using nested IFs).
6. Replacing "10+ miles" with "More than 10 miles" in the Commute Distance column.

  ### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory data analysis involved exploring the customer data to answer key questions such as:
 - Does the gender and average income of the customer influence the buying decision?
 - Is the age of the customer an influential factor for buying bykes?
 - Is it possible for commuting distance to influence the sales?

  ### Data Analysis

The data analysis of the dataset was done by using the following tools available in Excel:
 - Pivot Tables.
 - Bar and line graphs.
 - Slicers (for creating the interactive dashboard).

  ### Results and Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
 - The average income is an influential factor with the bike buyers having a larger average income than those who did not buy a bike.
Also, the majority of customers that did buy a bike are males, so gender can also be influential. It also discovered that male customers
earn more on average.
 - Middle age customers bought the most bikes which means that age has also influence on buying bikes.
 - Commuting distance was not found to have a strong influence on the buying decision.

  ### Recommendations

Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
1. The marketing campaign should be targeted towards the middle aged public (especially males) who have an average income over 56.000$/yr during peak season.
2. There could be a benefit of focusing and promoting the campaign to a more younger audience (especially females) emphasizing the benefits of having a bike
for commute purposes.
3. Implement a customer segmentation strategy to target the possible customers more effectively.

  ### Limitations

The dataset that was used in the analysis contained 1000 unique customer records, which is a rather small sample that may not represent the entire population needed to be taken
into account during analysis.

  ### Notes

- This project represents my practice work in the field of data analysis. The dataset used does not represent the reality and therefore the findings should be treated i accordance.
